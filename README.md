Battery Meter!
==============

An awesome online Javascript battery meter.

## How it works
Battery Meter uses Javascript and no PHP at all. Chrome and Firefox both have their own battery APIs, which are used differently. Battery Meter uses both of those APIs. It detects if you are using Chrome or Firefox.
